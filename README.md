## Technical details

### HEROKU DEPLOY

To use this `heroku-deploy` branch:

```bash
git checkout heroku-deploy
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
npm run build-front
git add client/build
git commit --allow-empty -m "build heroku"
git push --force
git checkout master
```

or simply

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### How to use add_file.sh script

From any folder you can launch:

``` bash
bash add_file.sh $NAME_OF_bLOCK_REPO $AbSOLUTE_PATH_TO_FILE
```

Keep in mind that you should have a push access to the repository. If you want to create a new repo for files (we call it 'block'), you should have the rights to create a new repo.
